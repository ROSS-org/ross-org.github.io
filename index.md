title: "ROSS: Rensselaer's Optimistic Simulation System"

# Welcome

ROSS is an acronym for Rensselaerâ€™s Optimistic Simulation System. It is a parallel discrete-event simulator that executes on multiprocessor systems and/or supercomputers. ROSS is geared for running large-scale simulation models (millions of object models).

This site contains [documentation](./documentation.html) for both ROSS users (aka model developers) and ROSS developers. It also contains a [brief history](./about.html) with links to [related publications](./refs.html).

If you are currently developing a ROSS model and would like to request a new feature, please create an [Issue on Github](http://github.com/ross-org/ROSS/issues).
