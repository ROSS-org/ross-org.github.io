title: "Default Clock: Get-Time-of-Day"

With [PR #170](https://github.com/ross-org/ROSS/pull/170) there is a new default clock based on the system `gettimeofday` function.
This means that ROSS can function on any architecture, even if a processor-specific system clock is not implemented.
More details on the `gettimeofday` function can be found on the [linux man page](https://linux.die.net/man/2/gettimeofday).
