Our new release is packed with new features and bug fixes!! :D

Bug fixes:

- Tiebreaker random generator bug fix [165d42d](https://github.com/ROSS-org/ROSS/commit/165d42d08368c584e4c4e11653f6eefca0e06ed9)
- Computing GVT with tiebreaker signature instead of just floating point number [4f6144b](https://github.com/ROSS-org/ROSS/commit/4f6144bfa8b4ef8e830b71c058b59ccb9fd75bdb)

With these bug fixes, ROSS can guarantee deterministic execution of a parallel optimsitic simulation (the tiebreaker mechanism has to be enabled; it is enabled by default).

New features:

- Arguments to the model can now be passed in a file ([doc/post link](/feature/args-file.html))
- Reverse handlers can be checked one by one ([doc/post link](/feature/checking-reverse-handler.html))
- We can pause `tw_run()` to execute a GVT hook function ([doc/post link](/feature/gvt-hook.html))
