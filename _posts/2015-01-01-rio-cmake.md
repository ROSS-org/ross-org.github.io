Distribution of RIO is included with ROSS as a git-submodule.[^1]
The RIO package itself can be turned on or off through CMake.
Thus, there should be no performance impact on those users who do not use RIO.

## Getting RIO

To download the RIO submodule simply load the submodule.
From your ROSS repository type:

```
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
```

## Adding RIO in CMake

Adding the RIO package requires a CMake include and link command.
Note that when linking libraries for your target, link with ROSS before RIO.

```
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${ROSS_SOURCE_DIR} ${ROSS_BINARY_DIR})
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${RIO_SOURCE_DIR} ${RIO_BINARY_DIR})
    ADD_EXECUTABLE(model.exe model.h model.c)
    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(model.exe ROSS RIO m)
```

Note that this model now *requires* the RIO package.
See the dpholdio target within [PHOLD-IO](https://github.com/gonsie/pholdio) for an example how to make RIO a CMake-configurable, optional package.

## Turning on RIO

RIO has some direct modifications to the ROSS code.
To keep the ROSS core functionality as lean as possible, the RIO code has been surrounded by `#ifdef USE_RIO` pragmas.
Thus, the user must remember to turn on the RIO package within CMake when compiling and building the ROSS library.

This can be done either within the `ccmake` editor or through the `cmake` command line option `-DUSE_RIO=ON`.
