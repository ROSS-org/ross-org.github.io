The latest version of the RIO API for ROSS checkpoints has just been released!
The RIO project can be found [here](http://github.com/ross-org/RIO).

This version has many core features, including event capturing, allowing multiple partitions per MPI rank, and optimistic mode support.
Additionally, all of the RIO documentation has been ported to the ROSS blog.

## Overview

RIO is an API for creating restart checkpoints of a ROSS simulation.
These checkpoints are created after the completion of a ROSS simulation and cannot be created *during* simulation execution.
Thus, RIO is a system for checkpoint-restart operations.

RIO version 2 offers support for optimistic schedulers (along with serial and conservative schedulers).

### Documentation

This release includes a complete set of documentation.
The documentation for RIO can be found on the ROSS website (Look for the RIO section on the [archive page](http://ross-org.github.io/archive.html)).
The documentation includes:

- [Overview](http://ross-org.github.io/rio/rio-overview.html)
- [API Description](http://ross-org.github.io/rio/rio-api.html)
- [Checkpoint Description](http://ross-org.github.io/rio/rio-files.html)
- [Adding RIO to a Model](http://ross-org.github.io/rio/rio-cmake.html)

### Example Usage

A full implementation of the RIO API can be found within the [PHOLD-IO model](https://github.com/ross-org/pholdio).
Integrating RIO into an existing ROSS model should be straightforward and simple to understand.
