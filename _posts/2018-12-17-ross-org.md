ROSS now has its own GitHub organization, [ROSS-org](https://github.com/ROSS-org)!

## Why Have a GitHub Organization?

By having a GitHub organization we can do two things:

- First, ROSS related projects and repositories are now clearly grouped together.
- Second, the administration of these repositories is greatly simplified.

## ROSS-org Repos

There are a number of repositories which immediately moved into ROSS-org.

1. [ROSS](https://github.com/ROSS-org/ROSS) itself
2. The ROSS website was split out from mainline ROSS into its [own repository](https://github.com/ROSS-org/ross-org.github.io).
   This should decrease the initial size of cloning ROSS as well.
3. [ROSS-Models](https://github.com/ROSS-org/ROSS-Models): the legacy models of ROSS (which may be somewhat out of date).
4. The starter [template-model](https://github.com/ROSS-org/template-model).
5. [RIO](https://github.com/ROSS-org/RIO): the ROSS I/O checkpointing framework, along with a demonstration model [pholdio](https://github.com/ROSS-org/pholdio).
6. [RISA](https://github.com/ROSS-org/RISA): the new in-situ analysis framework.

If other relevant models are out, we would welcome them in ROSS-org!

## Join Us

If you would like to join the GitHub organization (and get a spiffy badge on your GitHub profile), send a message to Elsa.
Then, be sure that you make your membership public (as on option on [this page](https://github.com/orgs/ROSS-org/people)).
