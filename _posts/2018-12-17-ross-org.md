ROSS now has its own GitHub organization, [ROSS-org](https://github.com/ROSS-org)!

## Why Have a GitHub Organization?

By having a GitHub organization we can do two things:

- First, ROSS related projects and repositories are now clearly grouped together.
- Second, the administration of these repositories is greatly simplified.

## Join Us

If you would like to join the GitHub organization (and get a spiffy badge on your GitHub profile), send a message to Elsa.
Then, be sure that you make your membership public (as on option on [this page](https://github.com/orgs/ROSS-org/people)).
