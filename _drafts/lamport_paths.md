Lamport clocks are a simple technique used for determining the order of events in a distributed system. First
    proposed by Leslie Lamport in a paper <a href="http://amturing.acm.org/p558-lamport.pdf">available here,</a>
    a Lamport clock maintains order of operations by incrementing a counter contained
    in messages. By simply adding a counter value to messages as they are received and incrementing this value
    based on the last seen value, Lamport clocks provide a simple way to determine order of events. Lamport clocks
    provide a <em>partial ordering</em> of events &ndash; specifically &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo; ordering.

&ldquo;Happened-before&rdquo; ordering is a partial ordering of events in a distributed system. The idea is
    that for two given events $E_1$ and $E_2$, there exists a series of events or state changes within all of the
    running processes that lead from $E_1$ to $E_2$. This type of synchronization is limited &ndash; since the
    Lamport clock contains only basic information about the ordering of messages, this clock really only has meaning
    when looking at the relationship of messages moving between processes. The other limitation of this technique is
    that these clocks can only show if an event happened before another event.

An easier way to think about this is to consider two events, A and B. If A and B occur inside the same process and A
    is processed before B, A &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo; B. If A is an event sending form a process, and B is the
    event receiving a message on a remote process, A &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo; B. Lamport also defined a transitive
    property, where if A &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo; B, and B &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo; C, then A &ldquo;happened
    before&rdquo; C. If A &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo; B, then A can be said to causally affect B. For example, if A is
    a piece of data that a remote process needs to use to make a decision, and C is the decision event:
<pre>
     P1| A ↴
     P2|   B → C </pre>

Using Lamport clocks, C can be said to have been caused or affected by A. If there is no &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo;
    relationship, then the events are considered concurrent.

As an example, of a Lamport clock, consider three processes running in a distributed system, $P_1$, $P_2$, and
    $P_3$. Each process starts with a Lamport clock, $L_n = 0$.

When $P_1$ processes event $A$, it increments its local clock by one. At the same time, $P_3$ processes a local
    event, and increments its clock by one. At this point, events $A$ and $L$ have been processed. $P_1$ and
    $P_3$ have a clock value of 1, and $P_2$ has a clock value of zero. Next, $P_2$ sends a message, $H$, to
    $P_1$ with a clock value of 1. At the same time, $P_1$ sends a message to $P_2$, with a clock value of 2. When
    $P_1$ receives the message from $P_2$ ($C$),&nbsp; it follows the Lamport clock algorithm of:

$clock_{t1} = max(message_{clock}, clock_{t0}) + 1$

This results in $P_1$&rsquo;s clock being set to 3. When $P_2$ receives the message at $I$, the clock is set to
    the highest value + 1 as well. Both $P_1$ and $P_2$ now have clock values of 3.

The rest of the diagram follows this algorithm. Lamport&rsquo;s clocks let us know specific information about event
    timing, but there are some things that are not known about the system. For example, it is impossible to determine if
    event $L$ happened before or after event $H$. The events might be concurrent, but Lamport clocks do not provide
    this information. For the purposes of the Lamport clock, events $A$ and $L$ are said to be concurrent.

Furthermore, we can say that event $F$ causally affects event $N$ from this diagram. However, even though event
    $H$ has a clock value that is less than event $I$, we cannot say that event $H$ happened before event $I$
    based solely on the Lamport clock information.

While the limitation of the Lamport clock makes its use case limited, within the ROSS framework this clock can be
    used to find a chain of related events. Since the &ldquo;happened-before&rdquo; relationship is transitive the
    clocks can be followed backwards to find a chain of related events. In the example diagram, there is a causal chain
    of events starting at $F$ and ending at $O$. This means that event $F$ affected event $O$. This information
    provides a way to trace messages that need to be rolled-back.
